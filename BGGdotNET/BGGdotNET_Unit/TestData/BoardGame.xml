    <comment username="0otTheMonk" rating="10">One of my favorite games of all time!</comment>
    <comment username="A Strange Aeon" rating="7">Sounds really fun--I never got to play the original Netrunner (too busy with Magic at the time), but the theme and asymmetry sound really cool. </comment>
    <comment username="abbeynormal" rating="N/A">Unplayed.</comment>
    <comment username="abravenewgeek" rating="9.5">Uber clever - the matrix meets (nearly) all the card game mechanics that I love. Hidden information, fantastic theme that fits well with the gameplay. A totally different way to play for each side and fabulous artwork. I am so happy that I have played this game! And the girl actually likes it despite the initial negative impression of the theme.</comment>
    <comment username="acolyte" rating="9">The new edition by FFG is an improvement on the original because it is no longer a CCG.  The asymetric game design is fantastic.  This game has a ton of depth, replay, and one of the coolest themes ever.</comment>
    <comment username="Adam78" rating="5.5">Loads of text on each card; loads of icons too. If you look up the meaning of the icons, you find they represent many forms of hacking-related jargon; so you&#039;re still none the wiser. This game will never tell you to &quot;Use this card to remove a green card from in front of another player&quot;, or anything so literal. It is so steeped in theme. There is probably a good strategic card game here, but my brain doesn&#039;t work this way.</comment>
    <comment username="adamw" rating="6">These things are not my cup of tea in the end. I dislike games that require intimate deck knowledge to be a superior player - and I can only assume Netrunner asks the same of its players. So nothing I need to have.</comment>
    <comment username="AdmiralGT" rating="10">Probably the best CCG/LCG to come out in a long time. Finally got me excited about them again. While deck building is required, good play is what separates the good from the bad. So many things to do and not enough resources to do them all. Can&#039;t wait until the data packs come out to really start deckbuilding.</comment>
    <comment username="Adonai_80" rating="8">Been a while since this was played, but fun game and very thematic</comment>
    <comment username="Aelf" rating="8">Excellent game, however I really wish there was a basic set of 7 balanced decks that didn&#039;t need the generic cards swapping about. I&#039;m not interested in competitive play.</comment>
    <comment username="aerhon" rating="10">Richard Garfield life masterpiece !!!</comment>
    <comment username="AlexBrown" rating="10">A fantastic reboot of a great game. Would actually replace Magic for me if the rest of my group wasn&#039;t so focused on Magic.</comment>
    <comment username="Alexfrog" rating="10">The awesomeness of original netrunner, combined with reasonable deck construction rules to remove the brokenness.  This reprinting of the greatest CCG ever is actually even better than the original!</comment>
    <comment username="alexgrant" rating="N/A">Just one solo play to learn the rules with the core set only. Seemed a bit uninspiring, but that&#039;s really not the putting the game in its best light :)</comment>
    <comment username="allworkandnoclay" rating="N/A">Fantastic unique LCG game! Quickly working its way up the ranks of my favorites.</comment>
    <comment username="aloehart" rating="9">A truly unique cardgame experience. The game is extremely well balanced and an absolute blast</comment>
    <comment username="andrewh63" rating="N/A">From Amazon for $30 on 9/14.</comment>
    <comment username="AndySzy" rating="8">I&#039;m quite intrigued by this so far. I like the asymmetry and bluffing aspects, and the different feels of the decks. I don&#039;t think Jinteki/Shaper is a great way to start though, as each initial game ended when the runner hit a trap or ICE that flatlined them. Wasn&#039;t super fun (although I imagine once we&#039;re done learning it will be!). </comment>
    <comment username="Anemelos" rating="8">Netrunner isn&#039;t collectible any more. Good news for this great 2-player card game. Gameplay remained the same. The 2 sides play completely different. Cool artwork that stays respectfull to the original one. </comment>
    <comment username="Angkor" rating="8.6">Building the deck is funnier than playing the game itself, but I think that &quot;building&quot; (setting up) a game is part of it, and creating the deck in this game is so exiting that it deserves it&#039;s current rank. The theme also is very appealing, a plus in an already good implementation.</comment>
    <comment username="Angrist" rating="10">The best game I have ever played. I simply cannot recommend it enough. It&#039;s the ultimate two player head-to-head game.</comment>
    <comment username="AnotherHorrorFan" rating="10">Absolutely incredible. Bought three copies of the core set so I am in for the long haul. My one fear, as a player who never played the original, is the game&#039;s expandability, as many mechanics seem to be written explicitly into the core rules rather than leaving them to the cards.</comment>
    <comment username="anovac" rating="8.5">After several plays there&#039;s still a lot to discover a about Netrunner. The rating is provisional until i gey to play at least all the pre-constructed decks.</comment>
    <comment username="awmiller" rating="9.5">This game is AMAZING! The only thing keeping it from being a 10 is the lack of deck building that is available out of the box. The asymmetrical sides (Corp vs Runner) in this game really allow for two very different experiences. I am sad that I missed the original, but overjoyed that FFG has brought it back for all of us to enjoy. </comment>
    <comment username="AWTama" rating="9">My favorite 2 player deck building card game that is not cooperative.</comment>
    <comment username="Bartas" rating="9">Very neat game, dragged me into LCG format. Fun, challenging, intriguing, I want more.</comment>
    <comment username="Base the Bass" rating="10">A very thematic LCG. I did have the feeling that I am a hacker, and there is a robust game. However I was not so excited with the development options as I was in Warhammer Invasion. Waiting for more plays.</comment>
    <comment username="Battlemind" rating="10">Android: Netrunner is probably the best card game I&#039;ve played over my many years of card gaming.</comment>
    <comment username="baughmm" rating="8.5">Great game!  My wife and I now have a few games under our belt and are ready to start deckbuilding.  Let&#039;s see if this goes over well.  </comment>
