BoardGameGeekDotNet
===================

Introduction
------------

This is a .NET library that aims to help developers intergrate the BoardGameGeek API.  Simply pull into your project and the client object will give you simple methods to use.  I've created this to help with the construction fo future websites I have planned and to also get more people building cool apps for a great hobby!

See http://www.boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi for more info on the library I'm creating.
